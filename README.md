This project utilizes computer vision techniques to create an interactive user interface that combines real-time webcam feed processing with hand gesture recognition. The main components and functionalities of the project include:

Webcam Integration: The system captures live video from a webcam and displays it within a graphical user interface.

Background Image: A static background image (Background.png) serves as the base for overlaying the webcam feed and other graphical elements.

Mode Selection: Users can interact with the system through predefined hand gestures recognized by the HandDetector module from the cvzone library. These gestures allow users to cycle through different modes displayed on the interface.

Mode Images and Icons: The system imports various mode images (Modes folder) and icons (Icons folder) to display selectable options visually. Mode images are resized and placed dynamically on the interface based on user interaction.

Interactive Elements: The project includes interactive elements such as ellipses that animate based on hand gestures, indicating selection progress.

User Interaction: Users can select modes by performing specific finger configurations recognized by the HandDetector. Each gesture corresponds to a different mode, enhancing the interactive experience.

Graphical User Interface (GUI): The final output is displayed in a GUI window (Background.png with overlaid webcam feed and mode images/icons), providing a user-friendly interface for interaction.

Control and Loop: The program runs in a continuous loop, updating the interface based on user input (hand gestures) and allowing for seamless interaction until terminated by the user.

This project showcases the integration of computer vision, graphical interface design, and user interaction through hand gestures, making it a practical example of interactive system development using OpenCV and related libraries.
